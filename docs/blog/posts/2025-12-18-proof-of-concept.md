# About This Proof of Concept

## Current Status: Proof of Concept

Awesome NAPCORE Tools is currently a **Proof of Concept** being developed under NAPCORE Task 5.2 (Digital Tools). This site demonstrates the vision for a comprehensive catalog of European mobility data-related tools and resources.

### What This Means

- ✅ **Active Development** - The site is functional and being actively developed
- ⚠️ **Not Yet Official** - Tools shown here are not yet officially endorsed by NAPCORE
- 🔄 **Governance in Progress** - We are establishing proper endorsement processes and quality criteria

### Timeline

**Q1 2026:** Official launch with NAPCORE governance framework in place

### What We're Building

The catalog will feature two tiers of tools:

1.  **NAPCORE Endorsed Tools** - Officially validated and recommended by NAPCORE
2.  **Community Contributed Tools** - Useful resources shared by the mobility data community

### Current Access

This development site is accessible to NAPCORE Task 5.2 participants and stakeholders to:

- Review the proposed structure and design
- Contribute feedback on functionality
- Prepare tools for official endorsement process
