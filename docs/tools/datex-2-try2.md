## Overview

DATEX II is the electronic language used throughout Europe for the exchange of traffic information and traffic data. Maintained by CEN (European Committee for Standardization) Technical Committee 278, it has evolved from a standard for exchanging traffic-related data between road-traffic control centres to a comprehensive set of standards supporting the digitalization and automation of the entire road transport ecosystem.

The documentation portal at docs.datex2.eu provides structured, multi-level technical documentation tailored for users at different experience levels - from beginners interested in the basics to experts assembling custom profiles. This unified approach ensures that road operators, service providers, traffic management centers, and developers can effectively implement and use DATEX II for standardized data exchange.

## Key Features

- **Multi-level documentation**: Tailored content for different user experience levels (Basics, Using, Mastering, Expert)
- **Standard profiles**: Pre-defined, case-driven profiles for common use cases
- **XML-based format**: Platform-independent data exchange using XML schemas
- **Multi-part standard**: CEN 16157 series covering various aspects of traffic data exchange
- **UML modeling**: Platform-independent modeling (PIM) with clear separation from platform-specific aspects (PSM)
- **Protocol flexibility**: Content specifications independent of exchange protocols
- **European coverage**: Network of 50-60 operational nodes throughout Europe
- **GDPR guidance**: Privacy considerations for data exchange

## Documentation Levels

The portal organizes content into four support levels:

### 1. DATEX II Basics
Tailored for people interested in using DATEX II who want to understand the fundamentals and core concepts.

### 2. Using DATEX II
First-level support for basic users implementing standard case-driven profiles for common scenarios.

### 3. Mastering DATEX II
Second-level support for experienced users working with pre-packaged solutions and advanced configurations.

### 4. DATEX II Expert
Third-level support for expert users who need to assemble custom profiles and implement specialized solutions.

## Use Cases

1. **Traffic management center data exchange**: Sharing real-time traffic data between control centers
2. **Service provider integration**: Enabling ITS service providers to access and distribute traffic information
3. **Pan-European services**: Supporting seamless cross-border traveler information services
4. **Road operator collaboration**: Joint traffic management operations between competent authorities
5. **Traffic incident reporting**: Standardized exchange of incident, roadwork, and event information
6. **Multi-modal integration**: Supporting data exchange from cycling to heavy lorry convoys
7. **EU ITS Directive compliance**: Meeting requirements of EU delegated regulations

### CEN 16157 Standard Series

**European Standards (approved 2018-2021):**
- Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 - Core specifications for DATEX II version 3

**CEN Technical Specifications:**
- Parts 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 - Additional domain-specific specifications (progressing toward European Standard status)

## Target Audience

- Traffic management center operators
- Road operators and authorities
- ITS service providers
- System integrators building National Access Points (NAPs)
- Transport data platform developers
- Traffic information application developers
- Road transport telematics professionals
- EU member state transport authorities

## Technical Architecture

### Data Content
- **Traffic incidents**: Real-time incident reporting and management
- **Road works**: Planned and emergency roadwork information
- **Traffic conditions**: Speed, flow, and congestion data
- **Road network status**: Infrastructure availability and restrictions
- **Weather conditions**: Road-weather information
- **Travel times**: Predicted and actual journey times
- **Parking information**: Availability and location data
- **Variable message signs**: VMS content and status

### Technical Approach
- **Platform Independent Model (PIM)**: UML-based data modeling
- **Platform Specific Model (PSM)**: XML schema implementations
- **Content/Protocol separation**: Flexible exchange mechanism support
- **Clear domain modeling**: Traffic domain concepts clearly defined
- **Extensibility**: Support for new data types and use cases

## Governance and Maintenance

DATEX II is governed under the NAPCORE project framework, ensuring:

- Strategic alignment with European transport policy
- Compliance with EU ITS Directive requirements
- Coordination with other mobility standards (NeTEx, SIRI, TransModel)
- Open stakeholder participation from traffic and travel domains
- Continuous evolution supporting new technologies and requirements

The standard is formally maintained by **CEN Technical Committee 278** (Road Transport and Traffic Telematics) through national standards bodies consultation and balloting processes.

## Real-World Deployment

DATEX II is deployed across Europe with:

- **50-60 operational nodes** throughout European member states
- **National exchanges**: Most nodes support domestic data sharing
- **International exchanges**: Cross-border traffic information sharing
- **Service provider networks**: Third-party access to traffic data
- **EU project implementations**: TEMPO, EasyWay, CROCODILE, and other EU-funded initiatives

### Notable Implementations
- National traffic management centers across EU member states
- Pan-European traffic information services
- Urban traffic control integrations
- TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Network) monitoring systems
- NAP (National Access Point) implementations

## Why This Resource Matters

The DATEX II documentation portal addresses critical needs in the European mobility ecosystem:

1. **Standardization**: Enables interoperable traffic data exchange across Europe
2. **Multi-level guidance**: Supports users from beginners to experts with appropriate documentation
3. **EU compliance**: Helps organizations meet EU ITS Directive requirements
4. **Cost reduction**: Reduces implementation costs through standardized approaches
5. **Quality assurance**: Clear specifications improve data quality and consistency
6. **Market enablement**: Promotes open marketplaces for ITS services
7. **Cross-domain alignment**: Coordinates with public transport and multi-modal standards
8. **Future-ready**: Evolves to support new data distribution technologies and joint ontologies
