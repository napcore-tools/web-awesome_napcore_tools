# About the NAPCORE Store

::: warning
This site is work in progress and in a proof-of-concept stage.
:::

The NAPCORE Store is a community-driven initiative to collect, curate, and showcase open-source tools that support European mobility data standards.

## Mission

Our mission is to make it easier for developers, data publishers, NAP operators, and mobility professionals to find and use the right tools for working with European mobility data standards like DATEX II, NeTEx, SIRI, and mobilityDCAT-AP.

## Why This Catalog Exists

### The Challenge

The European mobility data ecosystem is rich with standards and tools, but they're scattered across different websites, repositories, and organizations. Finding the right tool for a specific task can be difficult and time-consuming.

### The Solution

The NAPCORE Store brings these tools together in one place, with:

- **Standardized descriptions** so you can quickly understand what each tool does
- **Clear categorization** to help you find tools for specific needs
- **Quality curation** to ensure tools are functional and maintained
- **Community input** to discover tools through collective knowledge

## What We Include

### Tool Types

We catalog tools across nine categories:

- Validators
- Converters & Transformers
- Version Upgrade Tools
- SDKs & Libraries
- Reference Implementations
- Development Tools
- Data Quality Tools
- Testing Utilities
- Metadata Tools

### Standards Covered

Tools supporting European mobility data standards:

- **DATEX II** - Traffic and travel information
- **NeTEx** - Public transport networks
- **SIRI** - Real-time public transport information
- **mobilityDCAT-AP** - Mobility data metadata
- **DCAT-AP** - General data catalog metadata
- And other related standards

## Who This Is For

### Developers & Implementers

Find tools to help implement mobility data standards in your applications and services.

### NAP Operators

Discover tools for publishing, validating, and managing mobility data on National Access Points.

### System Architects

Explore tools and components for designing mobility data infrastructure.

### Data Publishers

Find tools for creating metadata, validating data, and ensuring quality.

### Students & Researchers

Learn about available tools and reference implementations for academic projects.

## About NAPCORE

**NAPCORE** (National Access Point Coordination Organisation for Europe) is a coordination mechanism to improve interoperability of National Access Points as the backbone of European mobility data exchange.

### NAPCORE's Mission

- Improve interoperability of mobility data in Europe
- Harmonize and align mobility data standards
- Increase access to mobility-related data
- Support National Access Points and National Bodies
- Define common procedures and strategy
- Facilitate creation of European-wide solutions

### Programme Support Action

NAPCORE is co-financed by a Programme Support Action under the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility. The initiative involves:

- **36 participants**: 33 Beneficiaries covering 26 EU Member States and 3 associated partners
- **37 Implementing Bodies**
- **Long-term vision**: Establishing a future-oriented platform organization

## Project Background

### Origins

The NAPCORE Store was created as part of NAPCORE Task 5.2 to support the European mobility data community by providing a centralized resource for discovering tools.

### Development

- **Built with**: VitePress (modern static site generator)
- **Hosted on**: GitHub Pages
- **Open Source**: All catalog content is open source
- **Community-Driven**: Tools are submitted and reviewed by the community

## Governance

### Managing Team

The catalog is maintained by the NAPCORE Task 5.2 team with support from the broader NAPCORE community.

### Review Process

Tool submissions are reviewed by the managing team with input from the community. See our [Contribution Guide](/contribute) for details.

### Quality Standards

We maintain quality standards to ensure tools in the catalog are:

- Functional and accessible
- Properly documented
- Relevant to European mobility data
- Maintained (or clearly marked if deprecated)

## Principles

### Community-First

The catalog is built by and for the European mobility data community. We welcome contributions from anyone passionate about improving mobility data infrastructure.

### Open and Transparent

All catalog content is open source. Tool submissions and reviews happen in public through GitHub Discussions.

### Quality Over Quantity

We prefer a curated selection of quality tools over an exhaustive list of unmaintained projects.

### Standards-Focused

We prioritize tools that support recognized European mobility data standards.

### Vendor-Neutral

We welcome both open source and commercial tools, provided they're accessible and meet our criteria.
