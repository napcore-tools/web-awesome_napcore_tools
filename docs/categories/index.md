## About Categories

Categories help you quickly find the right type of tool for your specific need. Each category contains tools that serve similar purposes, though some tools may span multiple categories.

::: info Multi-Category Tools
Some tools appear in multiple categories because they serve different purposes. For example, the ALERT-C Locations Tester is both a Validator and a Data Quality Tool.
