## What Are Development Tools?

Development tools assist engineers and data practitioners in creating, testing, and maintaining mobility data solutions.
They include SDKs, libraries, APIs, and utilities designed to simplify working with standards like DATEX II, NeTEx, SIRI, or mobilityDCAT-AP.

Typical users include:

- **Software developers** building transport applications
- **Data engineers** integrating and transforming data feeds
- **Researchers** prototyping and testing mobility data workflows

## Types of Development Tools

| Type                   | Description                                                   | Example                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **SDKs & Libraries**   | Provide reusable code for reading/writing mobility formats    | DATEX II Python SDK    |
| **CLI Utilities**      | Command-line tools for transformation, validation, or testing | NeTEx CLI Tool         |
| **APIs & Wrappers**    | Simplify data access or conversion                            | SIRI REST API Wrapper  |
| **Testing Frameworks** | Automate validation and integration testing                   | Mobility Test Runner   |
| **Data Simulators**    | Generate mock data for development environments               | Traffic Feed Simulator |

## Common Use Cases

### Application Development

Use SDKs and APIs to quickly integrate mobility data into software applications.

### Data Integration

Leverage libraries or converters to harmonize incoming datasets.

### Testing and QA

Automate validation, conversion, and functional tests in CI/CD pipelines.

### Simulation and Prototyping

Use data simulators or mock feeds to test new transport systems before deployment.

## Example Tool

**Mobility Data SDK**

- Provides utilities for parsing DATEX II and NeTEx files
