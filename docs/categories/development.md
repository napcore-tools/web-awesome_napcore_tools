## What are Development Tools?

Development tools are utilities that support your daily development workflow when working with mobility data standards. These tools help you:

- **Explore and understand** data models and specifications
- **Reference** standard elements and definitions quickly
- **Generate** code, schemas, or metadata
- **Browse** through complex specifications efficiently
- **Learn** standards through interactive interfaces
- **Validate** data during development
- **Debug** issues with detailed diagnostics

## Common Use Cases

### Quick Reference
When you're implementing a standard and need to quickly look up element definitions, relationships, or data types without digging through PDF specifications.

### Learning New Standards
Interactive tools help you understand complex standards like DATEX II, NeTEx, or SIRI by exploring them in a more intuitive way than reading specifications.

### Metadata Creation
Generate compliant metadata for your datasets using form-based interfaces that guide you through the required fields.

### Location Reference Validation
Validate ALERT-C location codes during development to catch errors before deployment.

### Code Generation
Some tools can generate boilerplate code or schemas based on your selections, saving development time.
