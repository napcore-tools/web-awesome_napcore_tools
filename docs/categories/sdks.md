## What are SDKs & Libraries?

SDKs (Software Development Kits) and libraries provide programming interfaces that make it easier to work with mobility data standards:

- **Language bindings**: Native implementations in Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, etc.
- **Data models**: Pre-built classes and types representing standard structures
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Easy conversion between objects and XML/JSON
- **Validation helpers**: Built-in validation functions
- **API wrappers**: Simplify interaction with mobility data APIs

## Common Use Cases

### Application Development

Build applications that consume or produce mobility data using familiar programming languages.

### API Integration

Integrate with NAP APIs or other mobility data services.

### Data Processing

Process large volumes of mobility data programmatically.

### Custom Tools

Build custom tools and utilities on top of standard libraries.
