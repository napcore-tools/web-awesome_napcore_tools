### What Are SDKs & Libraries?

SDKs and libraries provide **ready-to-use code components** for developers working with transport data.
They help parse, validate, generate, and exchange standard-compliant datasets without needing to implement low-level logic from scratch.

They're ideal for:

- **Developers** building transport apps or APIs
- **Data engineers** processing or transforming datasets
- **Integrators** creating standardized data interfaces

### Types of SDKs & Libraries

| Type                     | Description                                | Example                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Parsing Libraries**    | Read and write standard data formats       | DATEX II XML Parser    |
| **Validation Libraries** | Embed schema or business rule validation   | NeTEx Rule Validator   |
| **Conversion Libraries** | Transform data between supported formats   | SIRI ↔ JSON Converter |
| **API Client SDKs**      | Simplify communication with transport APIs | SIRI REST Client       |
| **Metadata Libraries**   | Handle DCAT-AP / mobilityDCAT-AP metadata  | DCAT-AP Toolkit        |

### Common Use Cases

#### Application Development

Quickly build standard-compliant APIs or data integrations.

#### Data Transformation

Convert and harmonize datasets in pipelines or ETL jobs.

#### Testing and Validation

Integrate schema validation within your application logic.

#### Metadata Automation

Generate or update DCAT-AP or mobilityDCAT-AP metadata programmatically.

### Example Tool

**DATEX II Python SDK**

- Parses and generates DATEX II XML files
- Supports validation and serialization
- Compatible with Python 3 and modern frameworks
- Open source, community-maintained
