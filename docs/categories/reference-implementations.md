## What are Reference Implementations?

Reference implementations are working examples that demonstrate how to properly implement mobility data standards:

- **Complete applications**: Full applications showing end-to-end implementation
- **Code examples**: Reusable code snippets and patterns
- **Best practices**: Demonstrate recommended approaches
- **Learning resources**: Help understand standards through practical examples
- **Starting points**: Serve as templates for new implementations

## Common Use Cases

### Learning
Understand how to implement a standard by studying working examples.

### Starting Point
Use reference implementations as a template for your own projects.

### Verification
Compare your implementation against a reference to ensure correctness.

### Teaching
Use in training materials and workshops.

## Needed Reference Implementations

We're looking for examples that demonstrate:

- **NAP implementations**: Example National Access Point setups
- **Data producers**: Publishing mobility data
- **Data consumers**: Consuming mobility data from NAPs
- **Converters**: Converting between formats
- **Validators**: Implementing validation logic
- **APIs**: REST or GraphQL APIs for mobility data
