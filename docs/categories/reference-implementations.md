# Reference Implementations

Working examples and demo applications that showcase best practices for implementing mobility and transport data standards in real-world scenarios.

## What Are Reference Implementations?

Reference implementations demonstrate how to correctly use or integrate a specific mobility data standard.
They provide **proven, reusable examples** that help developers, data providers, and public authorities understand how to build interoperable solutions.

They are useful for:

- **Developers** learning how to use a standard in practice
- **System integrators** implementing compliant interfaces
- **Public authorities** evaluating best practices and conformance

## Types of Reference Implementations

| Type                     | Description                                           | Example                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Data Exchange APIs**   | Implementations of DATEX II, SIRI, or NeTEx services  | DATEX II REST API Reference     |
| **Publishing Workflows** | Sample pipelines for data publication on NAPs         | NeTEx → NAP Publisher Demo      |
| **Metadata Catalogs**    | Example DCAT-AP / mobilityDCAT-AP portals             | Open Mobility Metadata Portal   |
| **End-to-End Solutions** | Complete integration demos showing multiple standards | Cross-Standard Integration Demo |

## Common Use Cases

### Learning and Experimentation

Explore working codebases to understand how standards are applied.

### Rapid Prototyping

Use example implementations as starting points for new projects.

### Conformance Testing

Compare your implementation against reference systems to ensure compliance.

### Demonstrations and Training

Support workshops or technical documentation with live examples.

## Example Tool

**DATEX II REST API Reference**

- Open-source implementation of the DATEX II REST interface
- Demonstrates schema validation and payload exchange
- Ideal for learning and integration testing
- Developed under the CEN/EN 16157 framework
