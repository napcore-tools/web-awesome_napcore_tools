## What are Validators?

Validators are essential tools that help ensure your mobility data meets specification requirements by:

- **Schema validation**: Checking data structure against XSD, JSON Schema, or other formats
- **Business rule validation**: Verifying domain-specific rules and constraints
- **Data quality checks**: Identifying issues with data completeness, consistency, and accuracy
- **Compliance verification**: Ensuring data meets regulatory requirements

## Common Use Cases

### Pre-Publication Validation
Validate data before publishing on a National Access Point to ensure quality and compliance.

### Development Testing
Continuously validate data during development to catch issues early.

Regular validation to maintain data quality standards over time.

Identify and diagnose specific data issues with detailed error messages.
