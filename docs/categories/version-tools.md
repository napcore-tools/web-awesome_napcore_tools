## What are Version Upgrade Tools?

Version upgrade tools help you migrate data and implementations between different versions of mobility data standards:

- **Data migration**: Convert data from older to newer standard versions
- **Compatibility checking**: Identify compatibility issues between versions
- **Automated conversion**: Transform data structures to match new schema requirements
- **Deprecation handling**: Handle deprecated elements gracefully

## Common Use Cases

### Standard Updates
When a new version of DATEX II, NeTEx, or SIRI is released, migrate existing data and implementations.

### System Modernization
Upgrade legacy systems using old standard versions to current versions.

### Multi-Version Support
Maintain compatibility with systems using different standard versions.
