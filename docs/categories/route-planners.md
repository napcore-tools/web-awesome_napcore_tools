# Route planners

Route planners are digital tools that help you find the best way to get from one location to another. They're the technology behind apps like Google Maps, Waze, and Apple Maps, as well as specialized navigation systems in vehicles and logistics software.

## How they work

Route planners use algorithms to analyze road networks, distances, and various other factors to calculate optimal paths. They typically consider:
- Distance between points
- Current traffic conditions
- Speed limits and road types
- Turn restrictions and one-way streets
- Real-time incidents (accidents, construction, road closures)
- Time of day
- Transportation mode (driving, walking, cycling, public transit)

## Common features

- **Multiple route options** - showing fastest, shortest, or alternative paths
- **Turn-by-turn navigation** - voice-guided directions
- **ETA calculations** - estimated arrival times that update based on conditions
- **Multi-stop routing** - optimizing trips with several destinations
- **Avoid preferences** - highways, tolls, ferries, etc.
- **Live traffic updates** - rerouting around congestion

## Use cases

- Personal navigation for daily commutes and travel
- Delivery and logistics optimization
- Emergency services routing
- Trip planning for road trips
- Fleet management for businesses
- Public transportation journey planning

The more advanced route planners use machine learning to predict traffic patterns and can even consider factors like fuel efficiency, vehicle restrictions, or scenic preferences when suggesting routes.
