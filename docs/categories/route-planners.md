# Route Planners

Applications and APIs that calculate, visualize, and share routes for transport networks — integrating mobility data from multiple standards and sources.

### What Are Route Planners?

Route planners compute **optimal travel routes** for vehicles, cyclists, or passengers, using transport datasets and standards such as NeTEx, SIRI, and DATEX II.
They enable multimodal transport planning, traffic management, and navigation services.

They are used by:

- **Public transport operators** for journey planning
- **Traffic authorities** for information services
- **Developers** creating mobility apps and digital twins

### Types of Route Planners

| Type                           | Description                                    | Example                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Public Transport Planners**  | Calculate journeys using timetables and stops  | NeTEx / GTFS-based Journey Planner |
| **Road Traffic Planners**      | Compute road routes and traffic-aware guidance | DATEX II Traffic Routing Service   |
| **Multimodal Planners**        | Combine modes (car, train, bike, walk)         | OpenTripPlanner                    |
| **Geospatial Routing Engines** | Compute optimized paths using map data         | OSRM, GraphHopper                  |

### Common Use Cases

#### Journey Planning

Calculate routes and travel times for multimodal transport networks.

#### Traffic Management

Integrate road events and congestion data from DATEX II feeds.

#### Real-Time Updates

Combine static NeTEx data with live SIRI feeds for dynamic route planning.

#### Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)

Power integrated travel apps and regional journey planners.

### Example Tool

**OpenTripPlanner**

- Supports NeTEx, GTFS, and SIRI data
- Provides multimodal routing and real-time updates
- Extensible open-source platform widely used across Europe
