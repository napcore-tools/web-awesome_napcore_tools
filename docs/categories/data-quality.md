### What Are Data Quality Tools?

Data quality tools help organizations ensure their data is **fit for purpose** before it is published, exchanged, or used in analytics.
They detect issues such as missing values, schema violations, or inconsistent references, supporting better decision-making and regulatory compliance.

These tools are often used by:

- **Data providers** – to validate and improve datasets before publication
- **System integrators** – to ensure data compatibility
- **Authorities** – to monitor data quality in National Access Points (NAPs)

### Types of Data Quality Tools

| Type                    | Description                                       | Example                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Validation Tools**    | Check schema and rule compliance                  | DATEX II Validator          |
| **Profiling Tools**     | Analyze datasets to detect patterns and anomalies | Mobility data profiler      |
| **Monitoring Tools**    | Continuously track quality over time              | NAP Data Monitor            |
| **Reference Checkers**  | Verify identifiers, codes, and locations          | ALERT-C Reference Validator |
| **Visualization Tools** | Provide dashboards for data quality KPIs          | Quality Metrics Dashboard   |

### Common Use Cases

#### Pre-Publication Checks

Ensure datasets meet standard and structural requirements before being published on a NAP.

#### Quality Monitoring

Automate recurring checks to monitor dataset quality trends over time.

#### Benchmarking

Compare datasets or data sources using defined quality metrics (completeness, consistency, timeliness).

#### Debugging and Diagnostics

Identify missing, inconsistent, or invalid data fields that affect downstream use.

### Example Tool

**NAP Data Quality Dashboard**

- Provides quality metrics for DATEX II and NeTEx feeds
- Supports customizable validation rules
- Used by multiple European National Access Points
- Open source and modular
